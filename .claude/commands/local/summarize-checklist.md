# Summarize checklist

Generate a method-level review checklist in markdown format based on the currently selected code file. Include:
- State properties
- Constructor
- Public methods (with signatures)
- Private methods (with signatures)
- General verification items

Do not include implementation details for each method - just list the method signatures as checklist items.

Provide the output in a markdown code block.
